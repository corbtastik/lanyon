## Continuous Delivery on PAS

One of the biggest challenges for development organizations is to take what they’ve invested countless brain cells into and promoting it along a process (ideally a short one) that ends with delivery of a working system...and not do this once, do this many times.  Having a system to support high pace development is key to success, stable quick delivery catapults IT into a profit center instead of a cost center. You’re delivery is an important differentiator, in fact it’s critical for survival.  Consider if you conduct flawless, sublime development but can’t easily and continuously deliver then what have you gained?

Getting bits from development boxes to production apps has traditionally been known as the great(void)but it’s great as in “bad” not “awesome”.  So much so generations of developers have used the expression…”it works on my machine”.  The ole “works on my machine” it evidence enough something upstream is disconnected.  How can we enable true seamless delivery let’s frame this picture first before we dive into more detail.

Let’s assume we’re going to develop all Spring Boot based apps, meaning we’re planting this framework across all apps in a portfolio.  Planting this seed at the code level will pay off big for day 2 ops but also helps build maintainable apps and take them through a life cycle.

Let’s start with the basics of being able to deliver and consider versioning on the outset because if we don’t then it will be a scramble at delivery time.  Spring Boot as an app tool kit is wonderful.  We’ve seen many examples how it enables developer productivity and one such way it does that is through Spring Boot Actuators.  Actuators measure and expose those measurements as HTTP endpoints that clients can call for information.  It’s a perfect way to expose app info such as versioning.

### Adding App Info

Configuring this on the Todo app is simple as we’re going to leverage Maven’s ability to generate [build information](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-build.html#howto-build-info) that will be consumed and exposed as a [BuildProperties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/index.html?org/springframework/boot/info/BuildProperties.html) bean which extends [InfoProperties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/index.html?org/springframework/boot/info/BuildProperties.html).

Add an execution for build-info in your maven ``pom.xml`` **see below**.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <!-- generates META-INF/build-info.properties -->
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>build-info</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

Once that's added do a maven clean package and run the app to access the version information **see below**.
